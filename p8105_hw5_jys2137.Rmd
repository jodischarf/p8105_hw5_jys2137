## Problem 1

This problem uses data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities gathered by the _Washington Post_. 

#### 1.1. Data import

The code below imports the raw data made available through a GitHub repository.

```{r raw_import}
hom_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv'
hom_read <- read_csv(url(hom_url), na = c(" ","Unknown", "NA"))
```

#### 1.2. Raw data description

The **raw** dataset has **`r nrow(hom_read)`** observations and **`r ncol(hom_read)`** variables, including the _reported date_ of the homicide; the _name_, _race_, _age_, and _sex_ of the victim; and the _city_, _state_, and _longitude_ and _latitude_ of the homicide. Note that there is a possible data entry error of 1 observation reported as being in _Tulsa, AL_ (which does not exist; _Tulsa_ is in _OK_). 

#### 1.3. Data cleaning

The following code chunk **cleans the data** by:

* creating a `city_state` variable which combines city and state
* creating a `resolution` variable indicating if a case was closed with or without arrest
* excluding the 1 observation reported as being in _Tulsa, AL_

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  hom_read %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved")) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
```

The **new, cleaned** dataset has **`r nrow(homicide_df)`** observations and **`r ncol(homicide_df)`** variables.

#### 1.4. Total number of homicides and unsolved homicides

The next code chunk summarizes _**within cities**_ to obtain:

1. The **total** number of homicides
2. The number of **unsolved** homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

```{r}
cities_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n())

knitr::kable(cities_df,
             col.names = c("City", "Unsolved Murders", "Total Murders"))

```

#### 1.5. Proportion of unsolved homicides in Baltimore

Focusing on the city of _Baltimore, MD_, we use the `prop.test` function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved and the `broom::tidy` function to pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting dataframe.

```{r}
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_summary = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n())

 baltimore_test =
   prop.test(
    x = baltimore_summary %>% pull(unsolved), 
    n = baltimore_summary %>% pull(n)) 
 
 
baltimore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(-parameter, -alternative) %>% 
  rename(Estimate = estimate,
         Statistic = statistic,
         "p-value" = p.value,
         Method = method,
         "CI Lower Bound" = conf.low, 
         "CI Upper Bound" = conf.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3,
               caption = "_**Table 1: Estimate and CI of the Proportion of Unsolved Homicides In Baltimore**_",
               align = "ccccclc")
```

#### 1.6. Running `prop.test` for each of the cities in the dataset

Next, we run `prop.test` for each of the cities in the dataset, and extract both the **proportion of unsolved homicides** and the **confidence interval** for each. This is done within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`, `purrr::map2`, and `unnest`.

```{r}
results_df = 
  cities_df %>% 
  mutate(test_results = map2(.x = unsolved, .y = n, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
         tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-test_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))
```

#### 1.7. Creating a plot: Proportion of unsolved cases in 50 major US cities

The code chunk below creates a **plot** that shows the *estimates** and **CIs** for each city – and uses `geom_errorbar` to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits. Cities are organized according to the proportion of unsolved homicides.

```{r}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point(color = "darkred") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold.italic" )) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Proportion of unsolved cases in 50 major US cities", 
       y = "Estimated Proportion of Unsolved Homicides", 
       x = "City", 
       caption = "*Note: Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval")
```

_**Figure 1**_ illustrates that across the 50 major U.S. cities, rates at which homicides are solved vary greatly. Notably, **Chicago, IL** has a distinctly high proportion of unsolved homicides, at **over 0.7**. This unfortunately makes sense, as Chicago is a city with a high rate of homicides overall. In stark comparison, the lowest proportion of unsolved homicides is in **Richmond, VA**, at just above **0.25**.


## Problem 2

This problem involves data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the `subject ID` and `arm`.

#### 2.1 Importing the data
First, we import the data from each separate file of the study through the following steps:

* Create a dataframe `files_df` that includes the names of all 20 files and the path to each file using `list.files`
* Use `purrr::map` for the paths and save the result as a new variable, `file_name`
* Import data using `read_csv`
* Use `unnest` to accommodate for the `map` results

```{r}
files_df =
  tibble(
    files = list.files("./data/"),
    path = str_c("./data/", files)) %>% 
    mutate(file_name = map(path, read_csv, col_types = "dddddddd")) %>% 
    unnest()
```

#### 2.2. Cleaning the data
Now, we tidy the result of the previous data import through the following steps:

* Manipulate the file name to include control arm and subject ID
* Use string replacements for the file names
* Ensure weekly observations are tidy
* Changing the dataframe from wide to long
* De-selecting variables that are not meaningful for our understanding of the data

```{r}
tidy_df = 
  files_df %>% 
  mutate(file_name = str_replace(files, ".csv", "")) %>% 
  mutate(file_name = str_replace(file_name, "./study_data/", "")) %>% 
  separate(file_name,
           into = c("study_arm", "subj_num"),
           sep = "_",
           remove = FALSE) %>% 
  rename(subj_id = file_name) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(-subj_num, subj = files, week, outcome)
```
  
#### 2.3. Spaghetti plot of observations over time

Here, we make a **spaghetti plot** showing observations on each subject over time. For clarity, the **control group** is shown on the _left_ and the **experimental group** is shown on the _right_.

```{r}
tidy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = study_arm)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold.italic" )) + 
  labs(x = "Study Week",
       y = "Observed Measurement", 
       title = "Figure 2: Control vs. Experimental Arm", 
       color = "Study Arm") +
  facet_grid(~study_arm)
```

###### A comment on differences between groups:

Figure 2 illustrates a noticeable difference between groups. Subjects in the control group seem to stay rather consistent in their observed measurement over time, while subjects in the experimental group seem to have increasing observed measurements over time.
