## Problem 1

This problem uses data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities gathered by
the *Washington Post*.

#### 1.1. Data import

The code below imports the raw data made available through a GitHub
repository.

``` r
hom_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv'
hom_read <- read_csv(url(hom_url), na = c(" ","Unknown", "NA"))
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (8): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_sex, city, stat...
    ## dbl (4): reported_date, victim_age, lat, lon

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

#### 1.2. Raw data description

The **raw** dataset has **52179** observations and **12** variables,
including the *reported date* of the homicide; the *name*, *race*,
*age*, and *sex* of the victim; and the *city*, *state*, and *longitude*
and *latitude* of the homicide. Note that there is a possible data entry
error of 1 observation reported as being in *Tulsa, AL* (which does not
exist; *Tulsa* is in *OK*).

#### 1.3. Data cleaning

The following code chunk **cleans the data** by:

-   creating a `city_state` variable which combines city and state
-   creating a `resolution` variable indicating if a case was closed
    with or without arrest
-   excluding the 1 observation reported as being in *Tulsa, AL*

``` r
homicide_df = 
  hom_read %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved")) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
```

The **new, cleaned** dataset has **52178** observations and **14**
variables.

#### 1.4. Total number of homicides and unsolved homicides

The next code chunk summarizes ***within cities*** to obtain:

1.  The **total** number of homicides
2.  The number of **unsolved** homicides (those for which the
    disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
cities_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n())

knitr::kable(cities_df,
             col.names = c("City", "Unsolved Murders", "Total Murders"))
```

#### 1.5. Proportion of unsolved homicides in Baltimore

Focusing on the city of *Baltimore, MD*, we use the `prop.test` function
to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved and the
`broom::tidy` function to pull the estimated proportion and confidence
intervals from the resulting dataframe.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_summary = 
  baltimore_df %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n())

 baltimore_test =
   prop.test(
    x = baltimore_summary %>% pull(unsolved), 
    n = baltimore_summary %>% pull(n)) 
 
 
baltimore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(-parameter, -alternative) %>% 
  rename(Estimate = estimate,
         Statistic = statistic,
         "p-value" = p.value,
         Method = method,
         "CI Lower Bound" = conf.low, 
         "CI Upper Bound" = conf.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3,
               caption = "_**Table 1: Estimate and CI of the Proportion of Unsolved Homicides In Baltimore**_",
               align = "ccccclc")
```

| Estimate | Statistic | p-value | CI Lower Bound | CI Upper Bound | Method                                               |
|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|  0.646   |  239.011  |    0    |     0.628      |     0.663      | 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction |

***Table 1: Estimate and CI of the Proportion of Unsolved Homicides In
Baltimore***

#### 1.6. Running `prop.test` for each of the cities in the dataset

Next, we run `prop.test` for each of the cities in the dataset, and
extract both the **proportion of unsolved homicides** and the
**confidence interval** for each. This is done within a “tidy” pipeline,
making use of `purrr::map`, `purrr::map2`, and `unnest`.

``` r
results_df = 
  cities_df %>% 
  mutate(test_results = map2(.x = unsolved, .y = n, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
         tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-test_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))
```

#### 1.7. Creating a plot: Proportion of unsolved cases in 50 major US cities

The code chunk below creates a **plot** that shows the \*estimates** and
**CIs\*\* for each city – and uses `geom_errorbar` to add error bars
based on the upper and lower limits. Cities are organized according to
the proportion of unsolved homicides.

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point(color = "darkred") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold.italic" )) +
  labs(title = "Figure 1: Proportion of unsolved cases in 50 major US cities", 
       y = "Estimated Proportion of Unsolved Homicides", 
       x = "City", 
       caption = "*Note: Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_jys2137_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

***Figure 1*** illustrates that across the 50 major U.S. cities, rates
at which homicides are solved vary greatly. Notably, **Chicago, IL** has
a distinctly high proportion of unsolved homicides, at **over 0.7**.
This unfortunately makes sense, as Chicago is a city with a high rate of
homicides overall. In stark comparison, the lowest proportion of
unsolved homicides is in **Richmond, VA**, at just above **0.25**.

## Problem 2

This problem involves data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the `subject ID` and
`arm`.

#### 2.1 Importing the data

First, we import the data from each separate file of the study through
the following steps:

-   Create a dataframe `files_df` that includes the names of all 20
    files and the path to each file using `list.files`
-   Use `purrr::map` for the paths and save the result as a new
    variable, `file_name`
-   Import data using `read_csv`
-   Use `unnest` to accommodate for the `map` results

``` r
files_df =
  tibble(
    files = list.files("./data/"),
    path = str_c("./data/", files)) %>% 
    mutate(file_name = map(path, read_csv, col_types = "dddddddd")) %>% 
    unnest()
```

#### 2.2. Cleaning the data

Now, we tidy the result of the previous data import through the
following steps:

-   Manipulate the file name to include control arm and subject ID
-   Use string replacements for the file names
-   Ensure weekly observations are tidy
-   Changing the dataframe from wide to long
-   De-selecting variables that are not meaningful for our understanding
    of the data

``` r
tidy_df = 
  files_df %>% 
  mutate(file_name = str_replace(files, ".csv", "")) %>% 
  mutate(file_name = str_replace(file_name, "./study_data/", "")) %>% 
  separate(file_name,
           into = c("study_arm", "subj_num"),
           sep = "_",
           remove = FALSE) %>% 
  rename(subj_id = file_name) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(-subj_num, subj = files, week, outcome)
```

#### 2.3. Spaghetti plot of observations over time

Here, we make a **spaghetti plot** showing observations on each subject
over time. For clarity, the **control group** is shown on the *left* and
the **experimental group** is shown on the *right*.

``` r
tidy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = study_arm)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold.italic" )) + 
  labs(x = "Study Week",
       y = "Observed Measurement", 
       title = "Figure 2: Control vs. Experimental Arm", 
       color = "Study Arm") +
  facet_grid(~study_arm)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_jys2137_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

###### A comment on differences between groups:

Figure 2 illustrates a noticeable difference between groups. Subjects in
the control group seem to stay rather consistent in their observed
measurement over time, while subjects in the experimental group seem to
have increasing observed measurements over time.
